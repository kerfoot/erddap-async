The COL OOI Program is not responsible for the use of the data it provides.  
The reliability, quality and completeness of data obtained through OOI are 
intended to be used in an education or research context. It is assumed that 
outages and errors can occur and are dealt with by the users of the data. 
These data and software are not for use in operational or decision-making 
settings.  COL makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the data provided are 
accurate. However, there may be no Quality Control (QC) performed on data 
acquired and provided through the OOI program, and there may be no Quality 
Assurance (QA) provided on information on those data sets. If QC/QA is 
performed, it is described in the metadata.  The OOI program both produces 
and through collaborations within the geosciences community, gains access to 
data sets which may be redistributed either directly or indirectly at no cost. 
With regard to data distribution, all users must comply with any applicable 
U.S. export laws and regulations.
